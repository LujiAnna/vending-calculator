Javascript Test Driven Development

## Test:
[QUnit](https://qunitjs.com)

Methods: Assert, equal, deep equal


### TDD Steps

1. Write a failing test case
Use case/user/requirements/conditions/stories  for a function
Test must fail, else itâ€™s a duplicate, badly written or its a waste
Failure confirms the validity of the test

2. Re(Write) code to make the failing test pass
Test pass confirms the validity of the system

3. Refactor: Remove duplication

* Test-Fail : Code-Pass >>> Success is from Red to Green
